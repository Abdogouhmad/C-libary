# Hashtable Data Insertion and Printing it into a File

## Overview

This repository contains a demonstration of using a hashtable data structure in C to store user actions with randomly generated IDs. The purpose of this project is to showcase how an application can track user actions with unique IDs, allowing users to perform certain actions in the app and store them efficiently in a hashtable.
Features

1. Random ID Generation: The application generates unique random IDs for each action performed by the user. The random IDs ensure that each action is uniquely identified in the hashtable.

2. Hashtable Data Structure: The user actions are stored in a hashtable, which provides efficient data retrieval and insertion. Hashtable allows quick access to actions based on their generated IDs.

3. Data Insertion: The program includes code to insert user actions into the hashtable. Actions can be easily added to the hashtable using their randomly generated IDs.

4. File Printing: The data stored in the hashtable can be printed into a file for further analysis or long-term storage. The file output provides a record of all user actions performed in the app.
